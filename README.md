Here are some things i will do to learn to get things done by a deadline (your requests):
code a game in the terminal,
code a game in pygame,
code a simple app with kivy,
code a game with turtle,
code a simple side scroll game (takes the most time)
please give me a reasonable deadline based on the fact that a side-scroll game takes 1-7 days. Thank you!
